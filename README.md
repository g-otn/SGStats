# SGStats
SGStats is a Discord scraper bot specifically made for the [Smithtainment gaming network](https://smithtainment.com).
It is partially hard-coded to get information about their game servers and forums.

Along with the Discord bot, this Node.js application also runs a server which serves pages with the changelog and some redirect links directly to the Steam game servers.
You can check the live version of the bot with the updated changelog on [Glitch.com](https://sgstats.glitch.me/).

## Scraped data
Some of the data gathered for the network members includes:
- [gametracker.com](https://www.gametracker.com) data and generated images
- Steam user basic information through [Steam Web API](https://steamcommunity.com/dev)
- [Smithtainment Forums](https://smithtainment.com/forums/) specific posts
- Smithtainment server info through [Smithtainment Status API v2](https://dev.smithtainment.com/api/)
- SCP:SL server info through Kigen's [SCP:SL Server Browser](https://kigen.co/scpsl/browser.php).

Use the ``help`` command to see how this data is displayed. See [Screenshots](#Screenshots).

## Installing
Before runnning the bot, install its dependencies and set up the enviroment variables

#### Dependencies
```console
npm i
```

#### Environment Variables
Create a ``.env`` file in the project's root. These variables are needed throughout the code:
```ini
# Server
BASEURI=                       # The url of the server (Ex: http://localhost)
PORT=                          # The server port (Ex: 80)

# Bot
PREFIX=                        # The prefix character for commands (Ex: !!)
TOKEN=                         # The Discord bot app token
STEAMWEBAPI_KEY=               # The Steam Web API key

# Smithtainment
SMITHTAINMENT_API_KEY=         # The Smithtainment API v2 key
DEBUG_CHANNEL=                 # The Discord channel to send startup and specific error messages
FORUMS_CHECK_MESSAGE_CHANNEL=  # The Discord server channel to send the forums sections logs
FORUMS_CHECK_LOGGING=          # true or false, toggles logging at bot/commands/forums.js
FORUMS_CHECK_ADMIN_ID=         # Discord ID (numbers only) of user that can use the forums command
```

#### Running
```console
node main.js
```

## GameTracker servers
Some commands scrap, format and send GameTracker server information to the users. 
The information needed to access a specific server data on GameTracker is stored in a JSON file located at
``bot/data/servers.json``.

Here's how add a new server to the file:
```json
{
    "classic": {
        "name": "Classic PropHunt",
        "ip": "185.249.196.141:27515",
        "supportedByGameTracker": true,
        "gametrackerID": "6022841",
        "supportedBySmithtainmentAPI": true
    }
}
```
- **Object key** (Ex: ``classic``): The single word abbreviation for the server, used in commands
names and parameters.
- **``name``**: The name of the server, used in embed messages.
- **``ip``**: The ip + port of the server, used to build the target server URLs.
- **``supportedByGameTracker``**: True if server is tracked on GameTracker.
- **``gametrackerID``**: The server ID generated by GameTracker, concatenated in graph images URLs.
- **``supportedBySmithtainmentAPI``**: True if server is supported by the Smithtainment API. Only available on Smithtainment Gaming servers.

## Smithtainment forums checking
This bot scraps the Smithtainment network forums periodically to check for new recent posts on specific threads. 
If a new thread is found, Steam/GameTracker data from that post is retrieved if  available, 
and a notification message about the thread is sent in a Discord channel.

The thread can be associated with a server tracked by GameTracker. The configuration file for this feature is
located in the `bot/data/forumsSections.json` file.

Format example:
```json
[
    {
        "name": "Appeals Section",
        "rolesToPing": [ 
            "@here", "<@&421555402533975564>"
        ],
        "sections": [
            {
                "name": "Garry's Mod Ban Appeal",
                "fid": "443",
                "color": "RED"
            },
            {
                "name": "Garry's Mod Warn Appeal",
                "fid": "445",
                "color": "ORANGE"
            },
            {
                "name": "Discord Ban Appeal",
                "fid": "302",
                "color": "DARK_BLUE"
            }
        ]
    }
]
```
